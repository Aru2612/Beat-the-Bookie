(Code and Report for the Group Assignment of COMP0036)

## `Problem Statement: `
Build a machine learning model (classifier) that predicts the outcome of English Premier League (EPL) football match when just given the date and name of the teams playing. Real match data was used for this from: http://www.football-data.co.uk/

The model tested against the teams playing EPL matches on 11 January 2020. 8 games were scheduled for this day and the model was made to predict the outcome of these games.

## `Results: `
Out of the 8 matches used to test the model, 5 predictions were accurate. This makes the accuracy __62.5%__. The actual results vs. the predicted results are shown below:
